      <p>This summer, I took a 3 day roadtrip with my friend Alex. We headed north with no real direction, stopping at every point which seemed interesting on Google Maps. Along the way, we stopped at a beach in Cambria, hiked in Point Lobos, and stopped at Whale Peak. We ended up reaching Monterey and came back down to Big Sur to conclude the trip. Normally, I would've taken more pictures, however, I had already visited the majority of the places we went to so I just enjoyed the moment. Although I didn't capture any pictures, we also went to Pfeiffer State Park where we swam in a river for a few hours. </p>
